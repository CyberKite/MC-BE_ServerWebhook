# MC-BE Server Webhook
	
Adding Extra Features to the Bedrock Server Folder.  
Unfortunately designed for exclusively Windows  
  
I recommend customizing the scripts. I could probably read from a file, but i'm too lazy for now  
There's also a set of recommended icons supplied with the code.  
## Where to download the main software:  
[minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock)  
  
## How to build:  
download the repo?  
  
## How to install:  
drag the batch and the powershell script into bedrock-server-(version)  
also drag the icon somewhere and use a  
shortcut with the icon for extra fancy launching.  
  
## Customization:  
Change the **Hook** placeholder in the Powershell script to connect the server to something  
Change up the text in the Batch script to change the output
